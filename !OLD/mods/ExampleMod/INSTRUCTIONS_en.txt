-- FOR NOW ONLY BASIC MODDED STRUCTURE CAN BE MADE

-- MOD LOADER NOTICE: THIS SYNTAX IS CRUCIAL FOR ALL FUNCTIONS AND VARIABLES IN YOUR MOD.

-- Follow this syntax to ensure naming consistency and avoid conflicts with other mods or the core game.
-- If your mod is named "ExampleMod," use the following conventions:

--Prefix all your scripts with ExampleMod_

-- This naming convention helps maintain clarity, prevent naming clashes, and ensures a smooth integration
-- with other parts of the game. You can call methods from the core game without the "ExampleMod_" prefix.

--In Every mod you need to add at the root of the mod folder a main lua like you can see in ExampleMod.lua to init things

--For now the mod support chunk.populate : see mods that call addFunctionToTag("chunkPopulateTag", function(self, i, height, j) 
For making tiles/blocks : see mods that call addBlock + useCustomTextureFORHUDTile
